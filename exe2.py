EchoBot II
Having written your respond() function, you'll now define a function called send_message() with a single parameter message which logs the message and the bot's response.
    
    
    Use the user_template string's .format() method to include the user's message into the user template, and print the result.
    Call the respond() function with the message passed in and save the result as response.
    Log the bot's response using the bot_template string's .format() method.
    Send the message "hello" to the bot.
